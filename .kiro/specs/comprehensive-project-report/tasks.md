## Notes

- The current PROJECT_REPORT.md file is approximately 1,917 lines and contains substantial content for Chapters 1-3, but is incomplete
- Chapter 3 (Proposed System) is truncated mid-section and needs completion
- Chapters 4-8 are not yet written and need to be created from scratch
- Visual diagrams need to be created using appropriate tools (draw.io, Lucidchart, or Mermaid)
- Screenshots need to be captured from the running chatbot system
- Testing needs to be performed to gather actual performance metrics
- The report should be converted to a proper academic format (PDF or Word) for final submission
