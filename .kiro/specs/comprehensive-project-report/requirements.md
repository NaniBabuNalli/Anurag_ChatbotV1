# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for completing a comprehensive project report for the NLP-Powered Smart University Chatbot system. The chatbot is an intelligent conversational AI system built using Google's Dialogflow for natural language understanding and FastAPI for backend processing, integrated with MongoDB for dynamic data storage and a React-based frontend for user interaction.

The project report must document the complete system architecture, implementation, testing, and results in an academic format suitable for submission as a Bachelor of Technology mini project report.

## Glossary

- **Chatbot System**: The complete NLP-powered conversational AI application for university information management
- **Dialogflow ES**: Google's Essentials edition natural language processing platform for intent recognition
- **FastAPI Backend**: Python-based web framework handling API requests and webhook processing
- **MongoDB Database**: NoSQL database storing dynamic university information
- **React Frontend**: JavaScript-based user interface for chat interactions
- **Intent Handler**: Python function that processes specific query types and generates responses
- **Knowledge Base**: JSON file containing fallback responses for unrecognized queries
- **Webhook**: HTTP endpoint that Dialogflow calls to retrieve dynamic responses
- **Three-Tier Processing**: Query handling architecture using direct matching, Dialogflow NLP, and knowledge base fallback
- **Parameter Extraction**: Process of identifying key information (exam types, ranks, course names) from user queries
